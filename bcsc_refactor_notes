# sc functions migrating innet -> mzone

(1) Innet::runSumPFSCCUDA (placed in MZone, vars transferred)
(2) Innet::runUpdatePFBCSCOutCUDA (as above) 
(3) Innet::cpyPFSCSumGPUtoHostCUDA (placed in MZone, vars transferred)
(4) Innet::initSCCUDA (placed in MZone, vars transferred)

+ some auxilliary variables, like:

need to transfer innetconnectivity -> mzoneconnectivity vars (conduction delays and connectivity)
need to transfer innetactivity -> mzoneactivity vars (mostly stellate cell)
